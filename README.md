Hello,

I am Pablo Fern√°ndez, an engineer with a professional career of more than 15 years. I have recently changed my path towards the world of programming and management of technology companies. You are invited to take a look at my humble repository.

In this case you can find the backend and frontend of the final project of BootCamp that I studied between 2021 and 2022 to acquire knowledge in programming. I did this project together with 2 other colleagues, and we presented it to an examining board on 21 April 2022 in Vigo.

It is a retro technology sales website. Users can visit it anonymously but must register to post ads or to buy. The backend data is managed with MySql (user data, articles, pictures...) and we did the programming with Node and Express. The site sends mails for the verification of registrations and to inform about the key actions carried out. In the code you can find filters and various measures to avoid bugs and errors.

For the frontend we use React, with fully responsive pages and an aesthetic reminiscent of the 90s according to the contents of the web. The behaviour of the menus is very dynamic, with effects and transitions that ensure a good user experience.

I hope you enjoy it.

Regards
